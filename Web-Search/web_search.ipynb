            "While Lieutenant Waters survives, Tears of the Sun's shocking and brutal final action scene sees many of its main characters die in a hail of gunfire. The film was criticized for its overuse of military tropes, but the final battle scene saved this otherwise forgettable war movie. Netflix fans think horror movie that left them 'bothered for days' has the one of the most 'unsettling' scenes ever This specific film is often underrated despite its near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes ... To his horror, and ours, the lead discovers him. Related to Unsettling Movies: Best Horror Movies of the 1970s Offbeat wouldn't suffice to describe the plot of the film. Robin Hardy constructs his narrative primarily as a criminal investigation but explores a larger divide between faith and religion. In any case, the genre's laundry list of offerings means that war movies that do not debut to both critical and commercial acclaim are far more likely to fade into cinematic obscurity. With that being said, many outings of this ilk still happen to boast great battle scenes in what is otherwise a forgettable movie. Including films such as Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, Eraserhead, Twin Peaks and more, these are the 10 most disturbing scenes in David Lynch films.\n",

This movie was so bad we talked and joked through the entire thing like the robots out of MST3K. But it bothers me that none of us can remember the name of the movie or what it was about. The only thing any of us really remember was it took place is completely or mostly in a third world country and near the end this woman, American I think, was standing either topless or naked in a bunch of mud and was surrounded by young boys. Most of whom were somewhere around 12-14 years old. And they start covering her in mud and as they do so, they are groping her breasts and ass. Not sure if they were supposed to, but they were. I think this scene stuck with us because it was about the best part of the movie and the only thing even relatively exciting that happened. We kept watching hoping that it would get better at some point. That someone didn’t actually, from start to finish, make a movie that terrible. I hope someone can help, because I would really like that know what that movie was supposed to be about and what it was called. I thank you all in advance\"\n",
