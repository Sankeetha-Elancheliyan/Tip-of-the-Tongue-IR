            "Query 1/150: Very rare movie that is scifi/dystopian/experimental/surreal. It’s like Stalker meets el Topo meets Holy Mountain meets Alphaville meets Delicatessen meets Hard to be a God, like Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Lynch had a kid together. It was color, possibly Russian, and I don’t really remember the decade but want to say 60s or 70s, though could easily be more recent. It is VERY rare, there is only one crappy partial print of it, and that is what the youtube version is from. Lot of wide shots in a surreal wilderness, winter settings, strange bleeding saturation in some shots. Crazy costumes. Seriously one of the strangest films I’ve ever seen and my favorite films are strange/weird ones. If you’ve ever seen what you’re thinking of on a “best weird movies” or “you’ve never seen this!” list, that’s NOT it. I don’t think this film even has a cult following of ten people. It’s an actual rare gem. Have been looking through selections at 366 Weird Movies and not found it yet (btw the way most of those titles are exactly the kind of not-actually-rare movies this film is definitely not).\n",

            "Query 2/150: I hope someone can help me track down this movie. I may have some details mixed up, or combined with another drama, so if you have any suggestions at all, please share them. There is a Caucasian man, who is a little person, who is successful in his working life but is lonely in his private life. He may be a writer or editor, or some such professional. I think part of the plot is that he might have trouble making friends because some people are prejudiced against his size. Sometimes he abuses alcohol because of this. He re-connects with a woman he knew when he was a child, even though she used to tease him back when they were children. They become friends and eventually fall in love. She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it’s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well. If you have any ideas at all, no matter how far fetched, please share them. Thank you in advance for any suggestions you may have.\n",

Another scene is where one girl is in the shower, drinking beer, and the other girl joins her and the have sex in the shower. Another scene which I’m not sure if it’s even part of the movie or not, the girls break in to an old lady’s trailer home and molest her, wear her underwear, and then a cop finds them and kills them.

            "Query 17/150: Ok so all i can remember from this movie is… Its like a group or a family who end up at this strange haunted raggedy looking house an I remember it had alot of cars parked in the front and the family that lives there are a bunch of weirdos. There is one baled old man who walks with a cane and i believe they run an inn or have rooms that the group of people rent. The family looks like a bunch of hillbillies and they taunt the people that rent a room. I believe it is a twisted comedy I know this isnt much help but i just cant remember anything specifically. ALSO it has a well know actor in it.\n",

            "Query 18/150: There’s a young woman standing in a shop, looks like an antique or curio store, and she is staring out the window. I believe she had dark hair, but it’s black and white, so it might have been hard to tell. I think there was another woman with her to the right on screen, who ran the shop. The camera cuts to the window, where outside some little girls are jumping rope and chanting a nursery rhyme. They might be blond. I think there are two of them. It cuts back to the woman looking out the window, who says “Those kids-” and looks horrified or scared. The kids had a creepy vibe, like children in a horror movie. I guess there was some significance to them. That’s all I remember, so the woman may have finished her sentence and I forgot it. For a while I was convinced that it was from the old Twilight Zone episodes from the sixties, but I watched all the ones I have and haven’t seen anything like that. I also keep searching on the Internet about this show and girls jumping rope, but nothing helpful comes up. I saw it a long time ago when I was a kid, maybe ten years ago, so my memory is fuzzy. There’s the gist of it; I may have gotten some details wrong. Thanks so much if you can help!\n",

Several neighbor families in a new suburb.  The families are all white but from different socioeconomic classes, professionals, tradesmen, white-collar workers all living in harmony. Not all of them have children. One of the men, played by someone who looks a bit like Charles Bronson, is angry. The plot hinges on this. The conflict ends as he is on his carport working under his car when the jack slips and he is crushed under the wheel. His wife and kid presumably move away, much happier now that their angry husband/father is gone, but also with trepidation because in spite of it all, they loved him and he was the breadwinner.\n",

            "Query 27/150: From what I remember it involved 3-4 astronauts.  One stays in orbit (a black man), while the others go to the surface of this planet. The ones on the surface are there to retrieve data (from probes perhaps?). The astronauts on the surface only have a limited time to collect this data and get back to the ship in orbit.  I think something happens to shorten their time there (a storm maybe?).  During this scene they were surrounded by water if I remember correctly. The female (possibly the crew leader?) keeps saying she can finish the data collection in time because it’ll be ages before they can get another chance.  She says this despite the warnings from her comrades to just leave.  Well, they miss their chance to get back to the ship in orbit. Now the kicker is that the time on the planet’s surface is vastly different to the time in orbit.  For instance, on the surface perhaps only a few hours pass, but in orbit several years pass.  I think it ends up being something like 20+ years to the man in orbit before the surface crew gets back. Anyone know what this movie is?  I watched it in the last 3 years, but I streamed it so the movie itself could be older.  Although I don’t think it would be more then say ten years old.  It’s in colour, an American film in English.\n",

He had to go on this long journey to find a wizard who could defeat the hyenas, and along the way he met a wolf who turns into a human, a little pink bunny-like creature, and a guy with a mosquito living on his shoulder.  The bunny guy comes upon  a tribe of Indian guys who worship him because he looks like their god. They eventually found the wizard, but before they met him/her the mosquito guy said that wizards are old guys with long beards. They meet the wizard who turns out to be a little girl. They ask her to defeat the hyenas, and she gives him a mirror. He realizes that he has the power inside him to defeat the hyenas. He releases his whole town and his mother and they all live.

It aired on TV sometime between 2008-2011 because I remember it well enough to have scared the living crap out of young me. I think it was on nickelodeon, Disney channel, or cartoon network because those were the only channels we had at the time, but I can’t find anything. I remember a town being haunted by something and people were going missing, so these kids figured out what was happening and it turned out there were these alien-like creatures who were stealing people and wrapping them in a cocoon made out of goo. I think it like, slowly ate away at the person but I can’t remember. I can vaguely remember a scene where they’re crawling through some type of piping system underground to find the creatures nest and they had to be super quiet, but the creaturest eventually noticed and took one of the kids, a boy a believe. The creatures were gooey with sharp teeth if I remember right too. Sorry for the really long post, but this is going to bug me forever if I can’t find this movie!!!!!!\n",

Each creature  had a single vertical stalk/appendage that it used to “look” around. The creatures didn’t have any eyes or discernible features and they were very alien looking.

            "Query 40/150: I believe this is a kids movie I saw on TV in the mid to late nineties. It was in color, in English, and may have been on one of the kids channels. The main characters are a sister and her younger brother, a family friend who is like a big silent bouncer or bodyguard, and a young suave guy they meet. It’s an adventure-fantasy in some sort of future dystopia. I remember a couple of scenes… Suave guy sees the sister fight off some military types and invites her to escape with him through a security checkpoint in the desert by racing their flying boards past the guards. They succeed in escaping, and are later joined by the brother and bodyguard dude, much to the chagrin of suave guy, who thought he was ditching the weaker elements. Sister says she would never leave them, they’re her family. Later, the sister gets captured and taken to some sort of facility where she gets strapped to a gurney. She gets out of the straps by shimmying the gurney until the bottom release button is hit, then stretches her legs over her head to hit the top button. She wanders around the facility, running into the brother of a friend that is so doped up he doesn’t even know who he is. She is recaptured, and suave guy and co. break in to save her. The group have almost made it to safety when their way is blocked and bodyguard dude has to sacrifice himself to ensure their escape. The final scene shows the kids running around a beach playing and enjoying their new-found freedom while suave guy does a voiceover. It’s crazy the things we remember and the things we don’t… But if anyone can tell me what this movie is I’d be eternally grateful!!\n",

            "Query 41/150: When we were a few years old, my twin sister and I sat down and watched the strangest movie with our parents, and I haven’t been able to find it since… It starts out with a boy who gets kidnapped by these two homely-looking twin henchmen, who take him back to a sort of children’s colony/prison island. (I believe they took some sort of boat, possibly through a swamp to get there… My memory is a bit foggy…) When they arrive, they are greeted by this tough, ruthless villian-character, who forces them into doing chores or some sort of labor for him. (I remember I thought that he looked a like a Mexican luchador, but I could be wrong.) Any child that wouldn’t do so was immediately sedated and plunged into a comatose state inside what seemed to be a pod of goo. Ultimately the movie ends in all the children escaping and the boy waking up in a meat locker/basement/whatever to discover it had all been a bad dream. I remember there was also some sort of musical number… Something like an ode to the main villian (one of the henchmen had some sort of infatuation with him, idk) that went, “He’s so b-b-beautiful to me”. I know I’m not insane for remembering this because my sister remembers the same exact thing. I would guess it could be a movie from the 90s/early 2000s, at least before the year 2004.

The movie is developed in a funerary house, or at least part of it, on the ground level the house is like a regular funerary house with a small chapel-like room, and the basement is where the bodies are “prepared” for the funeral. The “bad guy” is a tall pale man who wears a suit, and I’m pretty sure he wears a hat too. On the last scene, the bad guy, who apparently survived to the usual horror movie drama is seen walking on the funerary house hallway until he reaches a body on an open coffin, he then grabs a syringe and pinch the body extracting (or maybe introducing) some sort of white-yellow-ish translucent liquid to the dead body. We can then see that after removing the syringe from the body, the bad guy licks a drop of the liquid that was dripping from the needle of the syringe. I cant remember well, but I’m pretty sure that the liquid played an important role in the movie.\n",

My only recollection of this movie that it was a high fantasy, sword & sorcery type movie that was on network television (I didn’t have cable) during daylight hours.  All I remember is a man in a dark red cavern with a sword talking to what looked like a very large dragon or monster which made either a deep booming sound or actually talked to him.  The monster appeared to be several stories tall, and the scene took place toward the very end of the movie, because i remember it ended soon after.  I believe it was the climax of the movie.  I know it is not the movie “Legend”, but it may be similar to that. Thanks for your help, this has been bothering me for 25+ years.\n",

It was in color, English, probably made for tv… A high  school age girl starts hanging with the wrong crowd and gets in some trouble. Her parents send her to a horse farm to work there hoping it’ll change her attitude. I think there are other wayward teens there as well. The farm is run by a woman who is, I think, a single mother. She acts as a mentor to the girl. At first, the girl resists, but eventually lightens up and starts to do well at the farm. She bonds with a horse and she’s happy and all is well. Then tragedy strikes. She gets into an accident (I want to say she falls off the horse) and she winds up in a coma in the hospital. Eventually she comes out of it, but she’s paralyzed. They bring her to the farm to see the horse in a wheelchair, but she’s mad and she blames the horse. In the end she magically gets up and walks again, forgives the horse, and is normal again. I think it was a pretty cheesy movie, but I was just thinking about it and wondered if anyone knew what it was. I did a google search, but I couldn’t find it.

It was about 3 or 4 people, maybe sailors, who are splitting after ending their service, and are in a bar. They somehow decide to meet again 20 or 25 years later, and write a letter to themselves they put somewhere in the bar. Then the movie jumps to years later, when they actually get back, each one expecting to be the only one to show up for the meeting, and tell themselves of their lives. Anyone remembers it?\n",

The place is all snowy and full of scary and paranormal activities occurring and they have to find a way to get out. Each time they carry out a plan and if it fails they run back to the car as quick as they can. The girl also starts having feelings for the boy over time and they kiss at around halfway through the movie only for the girl to discover that the boy had been urinating blood all this time(because of kidney damage following the accident)but he didn’t say anything. So at the end the paranormal activities get even more violent and the boy dies but the girl is able to get out of there and is found by the police. Please can someone tell me the name of this movie? Anybody relate to it or have watched it?\n",

Here’s what I remember: There’s a young guy who constantly wears an odd knit hat. He meets a girl. She asked him why he always wears that hat and he says it is because a lot of your body heat is lost through the top of your head. She asked if he needs to wear especially this hat, he says no and they exchange his hat at the lost and found. During the movie, the girl keeps contemplating selling her eggs because she needs the money, at the end of the movie she doesn’t have to sell her eggs after all for some reason. I hope someone out there knows just what movie I’m talking about. Thanks for thinking along.\n",

From what I remember of the trailer the man is not really a man but some sort of mythical creature, but having not seen the film itself, I cannot be sure.

I saw a movie in July or August 2014, I believe on FOX TV network in the U.S. It was a recent movie, I’d say from the last few years but could be as old as 2000. It was in color and in English and I’m assuming it is American made. For some reason, I swear Kirsten Dunst was in this movie and keep thinking it has something to do with The Virgin Suicides but it is not that movie and I can not find it when searching Kirsten Dunst. The majority of the movie takes place in a hotel or dormitory type building where the doors are numbered. There appears to be a constant party going on in the hallway. In one room, there is some sort of support group where young people gather and I’ve young man reads from a journal if some sort. This scene reoccurs multiple times with fewer and fewer people attending I assume because they were either murdered it committed suicide. In another room, there is a young couple. The male  us in a band. The female is a blonde actress that I thought was Kirsten Dunst but was a female actress I recognized, possibly a Disney actress? They are plotting murder in that room and the girl seems to be trying to leave her family. In another room, there is a girl sitting, hugging her knees. The room is all white. Mental institution? A woman comes in and appears to try to entice her into committing suicide. The theme of the entire movie seems to be that these people are all connected in that they try to convince others to either commit murder or suicide. Another young male is in his room at home, apparently watching deaths online but he can not leave his house. A murder us committed on the streets, by one if the young males. At the end, the male who read from the journal is in the support group room and the male who was in a band comes in and murders him. I believe that us how it ended. It was a very confusing movie as I didn’t see the beginning. I keep wondering if it was a dream but my dreams do not usually follow such patterns. Any help offered will be greatly appreciated.

The house was burned enough that it was exposed to the outside. I don’t know if his family was dead or simply gone, but he was apparently left alone after returning from some adventure. I believe the whole movie had a somber, sad tone and may have been a  fantasy in line with the Jim Henson movies of that time period (Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, etc). Unfortunately I cannot remember anything else about the plot or characters. Any help is much appreciated. This has been bothering me for at least 15 years.\n",

There was a man and a woman who were either spies but more likely criminals or detectives – very glamorous. At various times in the film they would draw tattoos or pictures on each other (or it may have been just him drawing on her) The scene I remember the most is she receives a phone call while in bed. The call is from the man who is watching from down below, outside her window. Naked she moves to the window. He says something about her getting dressed. From the back you see her take the tattoo pencil and draw the straps of a dress onto her shoulders. Been bugging me for a while now so good luck…\n",

Rough wood plank floors and a tub with feet. The scene involves watch sloshing over the edge of the tub. During the drowning, a necklace or rosary gets washed down the drain. I don’t know if this was a flashback or what but the next piece I remember is years later, somehow people find the necklace/rosary in the septic tank. Maybe the building burned down? Not sure.

One of the end scenes was the last young woman winds up falling in love with the son of the cannibal family, and it’s the last survivor young woman in the kitchen making soup out of the parents, I think their heads were now in the fridge.

            "Query 78/150: Hi everyone! I remember watching this movie at a theater somewhat around 1976-79. Most likely it was in black and white and of a Western genre. The plot is not that different from the well known “Curly Sue”, “Alice in the Cities” or even “True Grit” and revolves around a journey of a middle-aged man and a little girl through the Wild West. I remember this man as a corpulent black-bearded cowboy taking care of a girl who was either his daughter or some orphaned child. All I recall is just this one scene: The man and the girl are making pancakes (or tortillas), and the man is showing the girl some sort of a trick – he throws the pancake up into the air, then catches it, then throws and catches it again. At some point, he throws the pancake and it disappears. Then both man and girl lift their eyes and see that the pancake is stuck to the ceiling. Several years ago, I’ve been told that this film is, perhaps, “The Paper Moon” by “Peter Bogdanovich… However, I rewatched it a few years back and never saw such a scene.

I only caught it during the final scene. A guy is walking up a hill wearing nothing but swim trunks, from a beach if I remember correctly.  He seems distraught, and it begins to rain. At one point he passes by a tennis court and stares at it for a moment, sinister laughter echoing out as he looks. I think the laughter continues on in a couple other places he passes before he arrives at the steps of a house. While he tries to get the door open, the camera pans over to a broken window and goes inside – the room is dark and ransacked. Going back to the man who seemingly gives up and kneels down on the steps in defeat, the camera pans out and the credits begin to roll. The only other detail I remember is that it was playing dramatic/intense music during the scene.\n",

            "Query 91/150: The genre is sci-fi, action, adventure (but not that much of sci-fi actually). This movie was on TV in the early 80s, so most likely it’s from the 70s. It was a very simple, moderate budget movie without any special effects. It was in color, I think. A young man comes to a provincial seashore town having in his possession a piece of a metallic plate, decorated with strange symbols. As far as I recall they look like Phoenician alphabet. However, this is just a small piece of a bigger artifact, so this guy is looking for the rest of it. I really do not know why he comes to this particular town, most likely he has info that another piece is located somewhere around the area. Also there are other people looking for the same artifacts and they are in a competition. The movie is pivoting around this search and confrontation between the groups. So it’s mostly an action movie. I remember this scene at the very end of the film, this is how the movie ends. The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search. The end has this feel of the Incredible Hulk TV series. I remember asking my father about these metallic plates and their meaning. He said something like: These were parts of an artifact left by extraterrestrials who visited Earth in ancient times, the text on the plates revealed the date of their return. However, I’m not sure whether he was joking or not.\n",

The princess is excited, but when everyone leaves her alone with the baby, the baby does something (maybe bit her?) and the princess makes the baby turn over and the baby starts crying. The princess is scolded by everyone. Years later, when they’re both grown up, the princess is beautiful and fell in love?

And the blonde princess has to fight against the prince she’s in love with for the ‘future queen’s hand’, but it’s actually to make him remember her or something.   I can’t remember anything else\n",

Hi guys, I hope you can help me with this movie as it’s been stuck in my head for the last 30+ years. This is what I can remember; This is a sci-fi, I can’t remember where it is set or even if it’s on Earth, but there’s a group of people, maybe 6 or so. One of them is tough and has some sort of blades/knives as weapons. He can throw these and they come back to him – similar to a boomerang. One of the other members is a bit of a wimp (from memory). The wimpy guy takes/borrows one of these knives and I think he must throw it or something, anyway something happens and the tip of the knife sticks into his forearm. When the tough guy tries to pull the knife out, the tip breaks off and starts to travel up the wimpy guys arm. He decides to cut his arm off to save his life. That’s all I can remember. Except I think in another scene the knives are used to try and open a doorway to a cave or something. Any help would be appreciated Cheers, DrCarl.\n",

I remember having watched this film (highly possible that it was a miniseries) when I was a kid, I am 24 now and I believe I was under the age of 10 when I watched this. I remember watching it on the TV, it was in color, and the actors used English. Based on the graphics I would say that the feature came out sometime after 1980. Here are the snapshot scenes that I remember: A white woman (middle age) is shot in the knee by an arrow during an attack by Native Americans, she is then approached by a Native American who wraps some sort of beaded leather around her injured knee. Another scene: a woman desperately clings to and cries in agony as her dead baby is taken away in a carriage (maybe a sled). Another scene: a woman (think she was Asian) and a man (African American) are surrounded by a group of outlaws?, the outlaws stab the man ( I think he was stabbed in the armpit/rib area. The Asian woman is then hung by the outlaws, she was wearing a red dress. I also remember the woman who was shot in the knee living in a house with other women, one of whom has a baby. Woman with the baby considers shooting her child during the Native American attack to spare her child from capture or a more gruesome death. At another point, the slaves or servants (I don’t know if they were slaves but I do remember that they were African American) are hung by the Native Americans (though its possible that someone else hung the slaves. I really hope someone can help identify this movie/miniseries, I’ve read through dozens of descriptions of Westerns and nothing seems to quite fit. My mother, who also watched this, remembers the scenes I described but the not the name of the feature.\n",

            "Query 107/150: My friend has memories of this tv show he used to watch and have copies of on vhs but he can’t remember what the show was. He says it was an English speaking show airing around the same time as first generation Power Rangers, and the plot is about a boy meeting a scientist and helping him locate strange crystals. Together with the help of a warrior girl and a troll who’s hair glows when a crystal is near they travel in their ship across various dimensions in search of these things, and with all sorts of other adventures along the way. the last episode, to the best of my friends recollection, involves the cast’s ship being damaged and then forced to combine the crystals to transport themselves to a new location where another crystal is near. There the warrior girl bites a mushroom that turns out to be a living race and gets poisoned, and the boy goes off to search for a cure. I’m at a loss myself, but has anyone else heard of this show and can provide any more information? It would be appreciated.\n",

There is a half nude Arabian girl dancing around 5 men sitting on the floor, 3 of whom are playing instruments. There are two guest girls too who are also sitting and watching the dance. One of the girl hints the other girl about the dance. The other girl then stands up and starts stripping while dancing and gets full nude. The men also stand up and start clapping to encourage. The first guest girl also joins and starts stripping and dancing and gets full nude. Towards the end of the clip the music dies and the men form a canopy with their long robes and cover all the three girls. Can anyone help to identify the name of the movie?\n",

Plot – A man who i think was a doctor (worked in a lab) was exposed to some foreign mass i think a meteor or similar and a growth started to develop on him. Turns out this is a parasite and he eventually gives birth to a creature with several limbs. The creature is taken away, but the man fights for the right for it to be released under some sort of human rights or parental rights – I believe the main point of the movie was to discuss the rights of a child (or lack of) if it was not technically a human (half human/half alien) – I think the title of the movie was a word that defined this but I cannot remember it at all. There is a court case where the creature is in fact released into the control of the man (father). Thanks.\n",

            "Query 114/150: The movie starts out with an American family who are staying in some East European Castle with their young son. He’s like maybe 9 or 10. I think it was in Czechoslovakia, maybe Romania. It’s night time and the boy is running around trying to escape some thing that is chasing him throughout the castle and you can hear his parents screaming. He manages to escape the castle, but his parents are killed by whatever was chasing him. Years later he comes back with his girlfriend or fiancee and their going to stay at the same castle. Little by little, his behavior becomes eratic as he is slowly being possessed by whatever force lives in the castle. Eventually, he starts chasing his girl and is trying to kill her. She eventually makes it down to some hidden area where the mummified remains of some prince is sitting on a throne. Suddenly, the prince gets up and starts shambling towards her. He’s moving really slow since it’s all practical effects. Turns out he’s the one who has been possessing the guy. The prince was young when he died, I think, and wanted the kid to stay with him. That’s why he got rid of the guys parents. So, she’s being chased by both of them. In the end, she manages to get away and I think she ends up killing her boyfriend in order to escape. Then, the prince sits back on his throne and whispers “Stay,” over and over before it fades to black and the credits roll. Hopefully, someone here has seen it. I honestly think I only saw it the one time, but that mummy prince starting to move freaked me out when I saw it as a kid!\n",

            "Query 131/150: SO, I remember a B&W movie I saw on TV in the 60’s where an alien spacecraft lands (maybe ‘crashes’ is better) in the desert near a small town.  The humanoid alien befriends (or is befriended by) a woman in town and they talk in her home.  People start getting killed on the outskirts of town, because some kind of alien creature had gotten aboard the craft, and the creature is hiding in a cave outside town.   When he hears of these killings, the humanoid alien recognizes that these are due to this creature, and he goes to try to kill it.  His hand weapon has been damaged (perhaps by the crash) and won’t work.  He disassembles it on her kitchen table, and finds a part that’s damaged.  He decides that the wires on poles running around town have power that might be able to operate his weapon to kill the creature.   The woman takes him out to the road near the cave, he climbs a telephone pole, cuts the wires and hooks them to his weapon.  She got on a nearby telephone, calls the local power company, where the guy at the power plant switches off the power as the alien is cutting the wires and connecting them to his weapon, and then turns the power back on, at her request over the phone. That’s what I remember, anyway… What’s the name of it?\n",

Now, I’m sort of trying to fill in the blanks here so forgive me, but I believe the main character is an “Average Joe” of sorts and is in love with the popular girl.

She forgives him and they sort of carry on with the evening. Then she becomes oddly obsessed with him (or obsessed with him rejecting her in the end).

I first assumed it was Dune, but was never able to find such scene in it. It’s a sci-fi / fantasy type of movie, set in a desert-like place. A lot of dunes, wind, etc. It remember it having an old feel for the time, so maybe from the end of the 1970’s? The scene I remember involves a worm type monster (hence the Dune thoughts) that lived in a hole surrounded by the dunes. The main characters/heroes had to be careful not be dragged by this worm (tentacles?) back to its hole/den. This happens with one of the main characters, and I never forgot him being dragged screaming by the foot to the hole in the sand. The worm, or tentacle, was not large but long, more like a snake. I also seem to remember it being in the future, or maybe the characters had suits/astronaut gear. Thanks! ?\n",

I think, when they cut his hand and other limbs they noticed they remained moving, so it couldn’t be killed. They burnt the body. After which, the smoke from the fire went in the atmosphere, turned into a cloud and rained down over the cemetery. Which of course lead to infecting the dead bodies and they becoming zombies.

In one of the houses I believe there was a little girl that had a monkey that ended up killing her family. Upon hearing the story the couple decide they don’t want the house, the realtor shows them another house and the couple love it. Its a big house with a pool, but the husband asks why its so cheap and so the realtor tells him the story. A young guy lived there with his parents who were ever there and the young guy started having visions of a killer that wore a grandma mask when he killed his victims. Those visions became true and he finally went to a therapist i guess to talk about it. In the end he tells the therapist that he is actually there because he had a vision she was gonna get killed. Therapist gets scared, runs off and gets killed by the grandma killer. I think the kid gets killed as well. After the realtor finishes the story the couple refuse to look at any other houses and the realtor gets desperate and stabs the husband on the neck with the house key. The wife runs and tries to get a neighbor to help but she realizes that the whole neighborhood is messed up. I haven’t found this movie and I really wanna know what it is.

            "Query 140/150: Movie series spanned across 6 VHS tapes that I would rent at a Video Connection while growing up. In color, in English, rented films, don’t remember if ever on TV, had to have been released very late 80s but possibly up to mid 90s, I believe I would have watched between 1995-98. I remember the 2nd film having like a large alien race with bald/possibly Conehead resemblances that captured the main protagonist. I can’t remember if he traveled via spaceship or what. But those large aliens in movie 2 put him in a large terrarium type of setting like what a tarantula would be in, but I don’t remember if there were any threats like spiders, snakes etc. Film 3 brought the protagonist to a town and I swear one of the characters in the third film was basically a real-life raggedy Anne doll or something. There were other helpers in this town; a convention or type of fall festival was ongoing while the guy visited in search of the crystal or whatever it was he was looking for. Can’t remember films 1, 4, or 6 for the life of me, but I remember that at the end of film 4 there was a preview for the 5th one that included their spaceship or perhaps a subway train or something being attacked by like brown worm like monsters which was going to stop or crash what the protagonist was riding in. I feel like at the beginning of the series he may have been in his room on a computer and brought aboard a spaceship to begin the adventure. He may be brown/darker haired and have a new partner or group of folks tagging along eacf film or a new partner coming on board for the remainder of the adventure. I’m thinking he wasn’t alone. I can’t remember completely but I believe the 2nd film had a yellow vhs box showing large hands reaching into the terrarium, and movie 3 may have been bright pink as the box with the raggtedy Anne character on the cover with the main character and a few others. The ultimate questbor goal was to reunite their crystal shards or collecting so many pieces of a shiny substance. I don’t think they traveled through time, though it is possible. I never got to watch or find out how the series ended because the video rental store never acquired a copy to my knowledge. Please help me as I’ve struggled remembering this from my childhood since I originally watched them back then. Thanks in advance!\n",

Next thing I remember is a shooting scene, most people at the home are killed and I remember a younger person hiding and seeing all the blood shed but is unharmed. Then they are forced to travel through a desert? I believe it was a young girl and a boy traveling, at one point they dig in the sand and are able to find water and then at some point the come upon a cave. The end of the movie is them finally being rescued or finally crossing the desert. Please help I think about this movie all the time it’s been driving me crazy for years!\n",

            "Query 143/150: For the longest time I’ve searched to find the title for this movie but have had no success. The movie begins with a brother and sister walking to school. They cross the road which is all cobblestone so I’m assuming it’s a European movie. As they cross the road, the girl gets hit by a car and put into a coma. The family tries everything to wake her but they have no success. They finally find a doctor who says he can put the brother into a coma to rescue her and bring her back so he connects their brain waves through wires or something. The brother finds his sister at a cabin. She is on the pond playing and she slips through the ice. Her brother runs to save her and can bring her out of the water. This wakes her from the coma. I believe the girls name is possibly Frankie. I’m not too sure though. I saw this movie before 2010 but after 2000. It was on tv. It was in color, but very dark. Please try to find it! Hopefully someone else remembers this. My mom remembers but can’t remember the name of it either :/\n",

            "Query 145/150: Film Production Date: Unknown Film is in: Color Setting: Probably pre-Internet Actors: VERY MAYBE Sarah Michelle Gellar and Matthew Broderick, both quite young (teens) I have seen only one scene of this movie (or TV series episode?) that circulated the net as animated GIF with (yellow/white? subtitles), maybe on imgur.com or a similar site. The scene goes like this:  A young girl and a young boy (both 12-16, I’d guess), both half-dressed, seemingly a bit shy and totally clueless about sex, try to have either sex or perform a handjob on the boy. They stand in a simply furnished room with (IIRC) not much more than a bed, a chair and maybe a table.   They alternately make suggestions (more like guesses) how to go about it. When the boy makes a suggestion, he repeatedly refers to horses (“like I’ve seen horses do”, something along those lines).   One of the suggestions is that the girl should stand on a chair.   At one point, the girl tells the boy to stop making references to horses.   At one point, the girl removes her bra (no nudity is shown, thanks to the camera perspective / clipping).   At the end of the scene, the girl is seen having her hands near/in the boy’s genital area and remarking something like “oh, only so little (liquid)?”.  The girl had a “smiling dimple” that reminded me of Sarah Michelle Gellar, but I’m absolutely unsure. Even more so with Matthew Broderick. Any help appreciated!\n",

            "Query 148/150: i have seen this movie around a decade or two. It is colored. It is in english language. The plot is: the man (i forgot if it is a priest or a police… or neither) is investigating a cult slash village because there is something fishy about the town. The kids (might include teenagers) are missing. And it is because they are being collected by the mysterious cult. The nice thing about this movie is that the kids that are being collected should be physically beautiful (dont get me wrong what beautiful means, i just want to remember this movie). They are being collected because satan is coming back to earth beautifully. The scene i remember: the child is riding a horse in her nightgown and or with or without the man who is investigating. I think she was trying to seduce him if he was there with her on the horse. There is another scene that one of them, the child or the man is being dragged by the horse alone. Noone is on top of the horse. But it is sort of controlled by the cult using powers. Some of the kids are found but they are all kind of asleep or their faces are all cut off. The kid is the last one already for the preparation of the coming of satan here on earth to be beautiful. The dialogue i remember was: satan is coming back to earth beautiful. May not be exact. Ending: i think the cult didn’t succeed. You can say it was a happy ending for a thriller/horror movie. Or i could be wrong. Pls help me find the title. Ive been thinking about this for months already. ?\n",

            "Query 150/150: I remember watching an animated movie in the years 2009-2015. I don’t remember the name or any of the actors of the movie, but I remember a lot about it. First off, it was animated. It wasn’t super high quality, the people/things looked like silhouettes (you couldn’t see their faces or exact clothing details, but you could see the shadows of them). Second, it was about a boy and a girl acting out these “plays” in an old theater owned by an old man, who may have been their grandfather. There was also an owl in the theater, and it looked at the camera and hooted whenever they changed from one “play” to another. Third, to change from one costume to another, they stood on a sort of platform thing. It “scanned” them, and the silhouettes of the clothes they described appeared on their bodies. The plays/plots I remember are as follows : Boy gets put in prison (wrongly accused of stealing a necklace, I think), but gets pitied by a princess and she takes him food/clothing. However, the good princess’s evil sister tries to marry the boy when he gets out of prison. When he refuses/realizes she’s the evil princess, she curses him to be a wolf. Boy then eventually gets freed by the good princess. Boy finds himself in a city of gold, but an evil dragon rules the city. The dragon gives the people gold, but only if they sacrifice the most beautiful maiden to the dragon every month/year. Boy eventually slays dragon and marries the girl, who was the most beautiful at that time. Boy is in Africa/similar place and likes to play the drum, but is shunned for doing so. The girl’s father is the clan/tribe chief and is dying from illness. Boy gets thrown out of clan/tribe, but saves an old medicine man from a leopard/big cat. Old medicine man teaches boy how to play drum, which ends up healing the sick clan/tribe chief. The drum also makes the clan/tribe unbeatable in battle. Boy is an adventurer in a strange land where he crawls through a tunnel and gets put in prison. He has to choose/marry one of the king’s three daughters, but he doesn’t know which one. A bee flies around the head of the correct daughter because he fed the bee earlier in the tunnel. He also gets help from other monsters he met in the tunnel/cave. There may have been more, but it’s been years since I saw the movie. It was\n",
